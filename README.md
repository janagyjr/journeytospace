# Journey to Space  
Journey to Space  
Journey to Space is a simple 1.7.10 modpack centered around Galacticraft and ExtraPlanets.  

Buildcraft, RFTools, and Railcraft will help you gather materials and move them between points in style while the Thermal family of mods (Dynamics, Expansion, Foundation) provide more ores (and more ways to process them). With Iquana's Tinker's Tool Leveling you'll never want to leave your trusty pick behind, and ExtraTIC provides extra options for your Tinkering needs so when you do make it to the moon (and beyond) you'll always be well prepared.  

Iron Backpacks, BetterStorage, and Storage Drawers will ensure you'll always have room for all the ores and loot you find on your journey's, so whether you're travelling in space or to the end, you should never have to worry about running out of room!  

This pack contains the off-Curse mod OpenPeripheral All-in-One which apparently does update checking.
